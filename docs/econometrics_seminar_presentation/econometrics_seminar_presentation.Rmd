# Summary

-   Background & Research Idea
-   Data
-   Method
-   Results

**Contribution**: Purely empirical. Evidence for decline in jobs in Ohio's healthcare sector.

JEL codes: I11, I18, J21 ^[I11: Analysis of Health Care Markets, I18: Government Policy, Regulation & Public Health, J21: Labor Force and Employment, Size, and Structure]

# Background & Research Idea

-   Studies have measured the economic impact of COVID-19 crisis [@Adams-Prassl2020-ya]

-   Previous studies show U.S healthcare sector behaves differently from U.S non-healthcare sectors [@ushealthimpact]

-   At 14%, Ohio has one of the highest workforce employment rate in Healthcare sector [@healthpct] \

**Main question**: How did COVID-19 change labor market dynamics for Ohio's Healthcare sector?\

# Data

**Source**: Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) collects employment data as per Ohio Revised Code (ORC) 4141.13 (G) (see @ui)

**Period**: January 2006 to June 2021

**Variables**:

1.  Unique Location Identifier (a.k.a unit): A particular location or address related to Healthcare sector

2.  NAICS code: used to code industries as per @naicspdf. Code `r 62` corresponds to Healthcare sector. Within Healthcare sector, we have -

    1.  621: Ambulatory Healthcare

    2.  622: Hospitals

    3.  623: Nursing and Residential Care

    4.  624: Social Assistance

3.  Number of Employed persons: number of individuals that were reported to ODJFS by a unit and were part of its payroll

# Methodology

Let $E_{it}$ be defined as the number of people on $i^{th}$ company's payroll during $t^{th}$ time period, where $i \in \{1, 2, .... , N \}$ for some $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and $t \in \{1,2, ...., T\}$ for some $T \in \mathbb{N}$

Let monthly job creation be $JC_t = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} JC_{it}$, where

$$
JC_{it}=\begin{cases} E_{it} - E_{it-1}  &\text{, if } E_{it} - E_{it-1} \ge 0 ,\\ 0 &\text{, if } E_{it} - E_{it-1} < 0 \end{cases}
$$

Let monthly job destruction be $JD_t = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} JD_{it}$, where

$$
JD_{it}=\begin{cases} 0  &\text{, if } E_{it} - E_{it-1} \ge 0 ,\\ -(E_{it} - E_{it-1}) &\text{, if } E_{it} - E_{it-1} < 0 \end{cases}
$$

# Methodology

Let annual Job creation rate be $JCR_t = \frac{JC_t}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} E_{it}} - \frac{JC_{t-12}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} E_{it-12}}$

Let annual Job destruction rate be $JDR_t = \frac{JD_t}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} E_{it}} - \frac{JD_{t-12}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} E_{it-12}}$

Let Reallocation rate be $RR_t = JCR_t + JDR_t$

Let Net Employment rate be $NER_t = JCR_t - JDR_t$

Further, let $\widetilde{T}$ be the period when lockdown was announced in Ohio

Let average Job-creation rate before and after COVID be $\overline{JCR_{0}}$ and $\overline{JCR_{1}}$, where

$\overline{JCR_{0}} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{\widetilde{T} - 1} JCR_{t}}{\widetilde{T} - 1}$ and $\overline{JCR_{1}} = \frac{\sum_{t=\widetilde{T}}^{T} JCR_{t}}{T- \widetilde{T}+1}$

# Methodology

Similarly, Let average Job-destruction rate before and after COVID be $\overline{JDR_{0}}$ and $\overline{JDR_{1}}$, where

$\overline{JDR_{0}} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{\widetilde{T} - 1} JDR_{t}}{\widetilde{T} - 1}$ and $\overline{JDR_{1}} = \frac{\sum_{t=\widetilde{T}}^{T} JDR_{t}}{T- \widetilde{T}}$

Then, our job loss measure (JL) is defined as

$JL = (\overline{JDR_{1}} - \overline{JDR_{0}}) - (\overline{JCR_{1}} - \overline{JCR_{0}})$
